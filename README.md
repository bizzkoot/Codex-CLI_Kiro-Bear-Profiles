**Production-ready installer for specialized AI coding agents that implement structured development workflows with OpenAI Codex CLI.**

---

</div>

## What This Does

This script installs two complementary AI agent **shell functions**:

- **üéØ Kiro** - Strategic planner with gated approval workflow for requirements and design  
- **‚ö° Bear** - Tactical executor with incremental implementation and safety checks  

Both agents support tiered reasoning models and enforce role-based safety constraints.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download and install
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bizzkoot/Codex-CLI_Kiro-Bear-Profiles/releases/latest/download/codex_interactive_embedded.sh -o codex_interactive_embedded.sh
bash codex_interactive_embedded.sh

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc

# Do not run inside Codex CLI prompt. Open a terminal in your project repo and run:
kiro "Plan a user authentication system"
bear "Implement login form component"
```

## Agent Functions

### üéØ Kiro - The Strategic Planner
- **Purpose**: Requirements analysis and system design  
- **Safety**: Read-only sandbox, untrusted approvals (requires explicit user approval)  
- **Output**: Structured documentation (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`)  
- **Workflow**: Plan ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks (with approval gates)

### ‚ö° Bear - The Tactical Executor
- **Purpose**: Task implementation with deliberate execution  
- **Safety**: Workspace-write sandbox, on-request approvals  
- **Output**: Working code with incremental progress  
- **Workflow**: Plan ‚Üí Risk Assessment ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Validate (step-by-step)

### Model Tiers

| Command | Tier | Speed | Cost | Best For |
|---------|------|--------|------|----------|
| `kiro-min` `bear-min` | Minimal | ‚ö° Fastest | üí∞ Lowest | Quick tasks, simple queries |
| `kiro-low` `bear-low` | Low | ‚ö° Fast | üí∞ Low | Standard development work |
| `kiro` `bear` | Mid (default) | ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced | üí∞ Medium | Complex features, planning |
| `kiro-high` `bear-high` | High | üéØ Thorough | üí∞ Premium | Critical systems, architecture |

## Workflow Examples

### üÜï New Feature Development
```bash
# Do not run inside Codex CLI prompt. Open a terminal in your project repo and run:
kiro "Add OAuth2 user authentication"
bear "Implement OAuth2 login endpoint from tasks.md"
```

### ‚ö° Quick Implementation
```bash
# Do not run inside Codex CLI prompt. Open a terminal in your project repo and run:
bear-low "Fix validation error message typo"
```

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design
```bash
# Do not run inside Codex CLI prompt. Open a terminal in your project repo and run:
kiro-high "Design microservice architecture for payment processing"
```

## Workflow Deep Dive

### Kiro's Three-Gate Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant K as Kiro Agent
    participant F as File System

    U->>K: Feature request
    K->>U: Plan preview (concise)
    K->>U: PREVIEW requirements.md
    U->>K: APPROVE REQUIREMENTS
    K->>F: WRITE requirements.md
    
    K->>U: PREVIEW design.md  
    U->>K: APPROVE DESIGN
    K->>F: WRITE design.md
    
    K->>U: PREVIEW tasks.md
    U->>K: APPROVE TASKS  
    K->>F: WRITE tasks.md
    
    K->>U: Ready for execution
```

### Bear's Planning-to-Execution Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant B as Bear Agent
    participant S as System

    U->>B: Task description
    B->>U: Plan preview + risks
    U->>B: APPROVE or REVISE
    loop Incremental steps
        B->>S: Execute step
        B->>S: Run tests & validation
        B->>U: Results & next step proposal
    end
```

## Installation Options

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
bash codex_interactive_embedded.sh
```

### Non-Interactive Mode
```bash
# Overwrite existing embedded block without prompting
bash codex_interactive_embedded.sh --mode overwrite

# Skip reinstall if already present
bash codex_interactive_embedded.sh --mode skip

# Delete and reinstall fresh
bash codex_interactive_embedded.sh --mode delete
```

### Command Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--mode overwrite|skip|delete` | Control reinstall behavior when functions already exist |
| `--uninstall` | Remove embedded functions (with interactive backup prompt) |
| `--version` | Show script version |

## What Gets Installed

### Embedded Functions
In **v2.0.0**, Kiro/Bear are exposed as **shell functions**.  
The installer writes them into your shell rc (e.g., `~/.zshrc`). After installing, open your project folder and run `kiro`/`bear` commands directly.

Available commands:
- `kiro` (default mid), `kiro-min`, `kiro-low`, `kiro-mid`, `kiro-high`  
- `bear` (default mid), `bear-min`, `bear-low`, `bear-mid`, `bear-high`  

## Requirements

- **Bash 4.0+** (macOS compatible)  
- **[OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex-cli)** installed and authenticated  
- **OpenAI API access** with appropriate model permissions  

## Team Integration

- Use **Kiro** for new feature planning  
- Use **Bear** for implementation and maintenance  
- Review generated specs before approval  
- Version control all artifacts (`.md` files)  
- Choose appropriate tiers based on complexity and budget  

## Safety Features

### Kiro Safety
- Read-only sandbox  
- Explicit user approvals required  
- Preview-before-write for all files  
- Structured workflow enforced  

### Bear Safety
- Risk assessment before execution  
- Incremental, validated steps  
- Test-driven approach  
- Rollback-friendly execution  

## Troubleshooting

**"codex CLI not found"**
```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex-cli
```

**Functions not available after install**
```bash
# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

### Uninstallation
```bash
bash codex_interactive_embedded.sh --uninstall
source ~/.zshrc  # Reload shell to remove functions
```
